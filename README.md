# About "DMR^2 CMS"

Our team, over the course of three days, built a Content Management System (CMS) that allows visitors to: - See content on the app without being signed in.
When logged in:
    - Users are able to create their own ‘pages’ with a title and description, and create ‘posts’ on those pages that have a title and content.
    - Users are able to manage the content once it's created: Display it, Edit it, Delete it.
